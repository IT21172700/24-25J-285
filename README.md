<h2>Mobile Application for Enhancing Banana Farming Practices and Market Access</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Banana farming is crucial to Sri Lanka's agriculture, helping many farmers and contributing to the country's food and exports. However, farmers face problems like unpredictable weather, diseases, and changing market prices, which make it difficult to get the best harvest and income.​

To solve these problems, we created a mobile app for Sri Lankan banana farmers. The app uses smart technology to improve farming, manage crops better, and find better market opportunities. It gives real-time advice to help farmers make good decisions, work more efficiently, and increase their profits.​


<h2>Research Problems</h2>

- Harvest Timing Uncertainty : Farmers struggle to predict the best times for harvesting.

- Unpredictable Weather Patterns : Climate change leads to irregular weather conditions, affecting the growth and quality of bananas.

- Disease Outbreaks : Common diseases like Panama disease and Black Sigatoka threaten banana crops. Lack of timely detection and effective management leads to 
  significant yield losses.

- Market Access and Fair Pricing : Farmers often receive unfair prices due to fluctuating market conditions and lack of market information.

<h2>Main Objective</h2>

To develop a comprehensive mobile application that leverages advanced technologies to enhance banana farming practices, optimize crop management, predict market trends, and improve farmers' market access and profitability.​

<h2>Sub Objectives</h2>

1.Banana Ripeness Prediction​

2.IoT-Based Weather Prediction and Irrigation scheduling

3.Market recommendation through questionaries and chatbot​

4.Image-Based Disease Detection and Augmented Reality Visualization​
