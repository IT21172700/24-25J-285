## Mobile Application for Enhancing Banana Farming Practices and Market Access

## Introduction

Banana ripeness is key to determining the best harvest time, affecting both quality and market value. Accurately judging ripeness can be tough for farmers, especially with changing conditions. 
The Banana Ripeness Prediction feature uses computer vision and machine learning to analyze visual traits like color and texture, giving farmers clear, data-driven guidance on the optimal time to harvest, ensuring better quality and profitability.

## Research Problems

Harvest Timing Uncertainty : Farmers struggle to predict the best times for harvesting.

Unpredictable Weather Patterns : Climate change leads to irregular weather conditions, affecting the growth and quality of bananas.

Disease Outbreaks : Common diseases like Panama disease and Black Sigatoka threaten banana crops. Lack of timely detection and effective management leads to significant yield losses.

Market Access and Fair Pricing : Farmers often receive unfair prices due to fluctuating market conditions and lack of market information.

## Main Objective
